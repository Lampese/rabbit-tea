# rabbit-tea

A prototype of web UI framework, inspired by The Elm Architecture.
Currently it's only usable in js backend.

# Setup

run launch.sh in the project root:

```bash
bash ./launch.sh
``` 

This scripit will build the project with js backend, and launch the server with node.

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

# How to use this framework

For how to handle events, update the view and model, and communicate with the server, see `src/main` for examples.
